# ContentLib-Recipes
Repo for Custom Recipes for ContentLib

The main config is for base game modding

The [ModName]\ContentLib\... is modding setup necessary to change recipes of modded items (with the recipe change for the mod that adds said recipe)
in the example I have, it changes the Modular Load Balancer mod, which adds 3 different types of buildings (regular, filtered, and overflow).
For some reason I had issues with the filtered version, hence the redundant recipe (as well as using both folder structures)
You don't need both of the filtered recipes, and you don't need both subfolder types, I just haven't tested which one worked for me.
